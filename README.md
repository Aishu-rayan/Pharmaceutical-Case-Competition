# 2025 Gilead Pharma Case Competition
## MARA Therapeutics — Phase III RESI Trial Strategy

**Team Members:** Aishwarya Narayan, Gitanjali Roy, Sadgee Panday

## 📋 Case Summary

MARA Therapeutics, a global leader in infectious disease research, is preparing to launch the **Phase III RESI Trial** for **Ramafloxacin**—a novel small molecule drug targeting **multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB)**. The challenge: design a clinical trial site selection and implementation strategy across six African markets (Egypt, Ethiopia, Kenya, Morocco, Nigeria, and South Africa) to maximize enrollment efficiency while ensuring operational feasibility and a clear path to commercialization.

**Key Context:**
- MDR-TB remains a critical global health crisis with ~400,000 cases annually worldwide
- The 6 target African countries represent a combined **19,930 treatable patients annually**
- Success hinges on balancing high-volume markets for enrollment with high-function markets for post-trial distribution

## 💡 Our Proposal & Recommendations

### Market Prioritization
After rigorous analysis of disease burden, regulatory maturity, supply chain feasibility, and commercialization pathways, we identified **four priority countries**:

| Country | Rationale |
|---------|-----------|
| **South Africa** | Largest patient pool (10,920), established TB research infrastructure, prior trial experience |
| **Nigeria** | Second-largest patient pool (5,755), growing clinical trial ecosystem |
| **Morocco** | Advanced regulatory system (FDA/EMA recognized), expedited distribution pathways |
| **Ethiopia** | Cost efficiency via government tax incentives, emerging manufacturing hub |

*Kenya and Egypt were deprioritized due to enrollment risks, geographic concentration, and supply chain vulnerabilities.*

### 12-Site Portfolio — Three-Wave Activation Strategy

We recommend a **12-site portfolio** deployed across three strategic waves:

| Wave | Sites | Strategy | Timeline |
|------|-------|----------|----------|
| **Wave 1 — Fast-track** | Sefolosha Hospital, Kuminga Hospital, Al-Jawan Teaching Hospital | Rapid activation (30-60 days), achieve First Patient In | Q4 2026 |
| **Wave 2 — Standard** | Mandela University Hospital, Mutombo Research Center, Metu General Hospital, Tuach University Teaching Hospital, Hamilcar General Hospital | Drive patient volume at scale | Q1-Q2 2027 |
| **Wave 3 — Complex** | Nwora University Teaching Hospital, Ethiopia Research Institute, Deng General Hospital, Nash-Paul Research Institute | Strategic sites requiring longer setup, competitive advantage | Q3-Q4 2027 |

**Key Milestones:**
- **First Patient In:** Q4 2026
- **Last Patient In:** Q4 2027
- **Database Lock:** Q1 2029

### Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|---------------------|
| Site competition from overlapping trials | Competitive analysis, exclusive enrollment windows, differentiated patient support |
| PI inexperience at high-potential sites | Funded study coordinators, GCP training, buddy mentoring with experienced Wave-1 sites |
| Slow regulatory turnaround | Pre-contract EC/IRB dossier preparation, regulatory consultant deployment |
| Patient engagement & retention | Transport support, community health worker engagement, messaging reminders |

### Budget Summary

| Country | Sites | Total Budget |
|---------|-------|--------------|
| South Africa | 4 | $1,860,000 |
| Ethiopia | 3 | $1,262,000 |
| Nigeria | 2 | $930,000 |
| Morocco | 2 | $204,000 |
| **Total** | **12** | **$4,256,000** |

### Market Opportunity
Ramafloxacin is projected to generate **$6–13M annually** in MDR-TB treatment revenue, with potential for upselling and diversification into other antimicrobial-resistant conditions.
